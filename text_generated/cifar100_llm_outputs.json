The disk exhibits a dense, textured surface of tiny tubular florets, while the elongated, overlapping ray florets are smooth and often slightly recurved. The stem is thick, hairy, and supports a single, terminal flower head with prominent, spirally arranged phyllaries beneath.",
    "83": "Sweet peppers exhibit a glossy, smooth-skinned, blocky to elongated shape with pronounced longitudinal ridges and a broad, gently tapering apex. The flesh is thick-walled, often with a slight sheen, and typically displays vibrant hues (e.g., red, yellow, or green) when mature. The stem is short, woody, and recessed into a shallow, star-shaped calyx.",
    "84": "A table typically features a flat, horizontal surface (tabletop) supported by vertical legs or a central pedestal, often with symmetrical proportions. The surface may exhibit uniform textures (wood grain, polished metal) or smooth finishes, and edges can be straight, rounded, or beveled. Legs are usually slender and evenly spaced, distinguishing it from solid-base furniture like cabinets.",
    "85": "A tank is characterized by a heavily armored, elongated hull with a rotating turret mounted atop, often featuring a long cannon barrel. Tracks encircle the hull's sides, with segmented tread plates and road wheels, while angular armor plates and rivets or welded seams create a rugged texture. Common camouflage patterns include dark green or tan blotches on a lighter base, applied to flat and curved surfaces. The turret typically has a low, rounded or boxy profile, with periscopes, hatches, and sometimes reactive armor blocks adding surface complexity.",
    "86": "Telephones typically exhibit a rectangular or curvilinear form, often with a prominent screen occupying most of the front surface, flanked by a numeric keypad or touch-sensitive controls. They may include a receiver-like protrusion (for landlines) or a smooth, monolithic body (for mobiles), with uniform matte or glossy finishes. Distinctive features include speaker/microphone perforations, camera lenses, and ports or buttons along the edges, differentiating them from generic handheld devices.",
    "87": "A television typically features a rectangular screen with a flat or slightly curved surface, framed by a thin bezel, often with a matte or glossy finish. It may include a stand or wall-mounting brackets, and the screen displays dynamic, high-contrast imagery, differentiating it from static displays like monitors or framed art. The rear housing is usually uniform and smooth, with ventilation slots or ports subtly integrated.",
    "88": "Tigers exhibit a robust, muscular body with a large, rounded head, short ears, and prominent facial stripes radiating from the eyes. Their most distinctive feature is a dense pattern of vertical dark stripes on light orange-to-yellow fur, extending across the body and limbs, with a white ventral area. The tail is thick, banded, and terminates in a dark tip.",
    "89": "A tractor typically features a large, blocky chassis with prominent rear wheels (often deeply treaded) and smaller front wheels, a raised exhaust pipe, and a frontal grille with vertical slats. Its cab is often boxy with rectangular windows, and it may have a rear hitch or attachments like a plow or loader, distinguished by angular metal frames and hydraulic cylinders. The body is usually monochrome (e.g., green, red, or yellow) with minimal patterning, emphasizing utilitarian design.",
    "90": "A train typically consists of a series of elongated, connected cars with uniform cylindrical or box-like shapes, aligned in a linear sequence. Key features include multiple windows in regular rows, prominent wheels or undercarriage with visible axles and couplings, and often a distinct locomotive with a front-facing cab, smokestack, or aerodynamic nose. The body is usually metallic with smooth, reflective surfaces, occasionally featuring horizontal stripes or logos. Roofs may have vents, antennas, or pantographs for electric models. The overall structure is rigid and symmetrical, emphasizing linearity and repetition.",
    "91": "Trout are streamlined fish with elongated, slightly compressed bodies, small smooth scales, and a forked caudal fin. They typically exhibit dark speckles on a light background, concentrated along the dorsal and lateral surfaces, with a prominent adipose fin near the tail. The mouth is terminal and often slightly upturned, with visible teeth on the jaws and vomer. Fins are generally clear or lightly pigmented, with no pronounced spines. The lateral line is distinct and runs horizontally from gill to tail.",
    "92": "Tulips are characterized by cup-shaped flowers with six distinct, symmetrical petals (tepals) that often exhibit smooth, waxy textures and may display color gradients or striations. The leaves are lanceolate, with undulating margins and a glaucous sheen, arranged alternately along an erect, unbranched stem. The flower's interior typically reveals a contrasting central blotch or star-shaped pattern at the base of the tepals.",
    "93": "Turtles are characterized by a domed or streamlined carapace with scute patterns, often with dark edges on lighter plates, and a ventral plastron. Their limb proportions are stout, with webbed feet and clawed digits, and a distinctively short, thick neck supporting a beak-like jaw without teeth. The skin is typically scaly and wrinkled, with texture variations between smooth and rough patches.",
    "94": "A wardrobe is a tall, rectangular cabinet with one or two vertically hinged doors, often featuring smooth or paneled surfaces, equidistant shelving or hanging rods inside, and occasionally decorative molding or mirrored exteriors. Its rigid, monolithic structure distinguishes it from smaller storage units like cupboards or dressers.",
    "95": "Whales are large, streamlined marine mammals with a fusiform body, thick blubber layer, and horizontal tail flukes with distinct notches. Their smooth, often mottled gray or dark skin lacks external ears, and they possess a single blowhole atop the head, distinguishing them from fish and smaller cetaceans. Proportionally small eyes and a prominent, elongated rostrum are typical.",
    "96": "The willow tree is characterized by long, slender, drooping branches that often reach the ground, forming a cascading silhouette. Its narrow, lanceolate leaves are arranged alternately on flexible stems, and the bark typically exhibits deep, irregular furrows with a rough, ridged texture. The overall form appears gracefully weeping, with fine, pendulous branchlets creating a feathery, flowing canopy distinct from upright or rigidly branched trees.",
    "97": "Wolves typically have a robust, muscular build with a broad head, pointed ears, and a straight muzzle. Their dense fur often exhibits a mix of light and dark tones, with darker shading along the back and tail. Legs are long and slender relative to their body, with large paws and a bushy tail that is usually held straight or slightly curved downward. The eyes are almond-shaped and often amber or pale in contrast to the darker facial markings.",
    "98": "Adult human females typically exhibit rounded facial contours with prominent cheekbones, a narrower jawline, and fuller lips compared to males; body proportions often include a wider hip-to-waist ratio, softer shoulder angles, and less pronounced muscle definition. Hair texture and length vary, but longer or styled hair is common. Skin tone varies widely, though facial features often appear smoother with less coarse texture than males. Eyebrows tend to be thinner and more arched.",
    "99": "Worms typically exhibit elongated, cylindrical bodies with smooth, segmented, or annulated textures, lacking distinct limbs or appendages. Their tubular forms often show uniform width or slight tapering, with surfaces ranging from glossy to matte, and may display subtle longitudinal striations or muted banding. The body is flexible, often appearing slightly curved or coiled in images."

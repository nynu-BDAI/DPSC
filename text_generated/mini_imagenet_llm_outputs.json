The turret often features a dome-like shape with periscopes or vision slits, distinguishing it from other armored vehicles. Common color schemes include matte green or tan, but camouflage patterns vary widely.",
    "82": "Theater curtains are large, heavy fabrics with vertical folds or pleats, often spanning the full width of a stage, featuring luxurious textures like velvet or brocade, and typically bordered by ornate fringe or tassels. Their central parting creates a symmetrical split, with rich, saturated colors (e.g., deep reds or golds) common but not universal. Embellishments such as embroidered patterns or gilded trims further distinguish them from ordinary drapes.",
    "83": "A tile roof consists of overlapping, rigid, typically rectangular or S-shaped modules arranged in staggered rows, creating a repeating undulating or stepped pattern with visible grooves and ridges. The surface exhibits a matte or slightly glazed texture, often with subtle color variations between individual tiles due to weathering or material composition. The edges are sharply defined, and the interlocking structure produces consistent shadow lines along the overlaps.",
    "84": "A tobacco shop typically features densely arranged shelves displaying cylindrical or rectangular packaged products, often with glossy or matte wrappers, and glass-fronted counters showcasing cigars in wooden boxes or humidors. Prominent signage with bold typography and tobacco-related symbols (e.g., leaves, pipes) distinguishes it from generic retail spaces.",
    "85": "A unicycle consists of a single large, spoked wheel with a narrow rubber tire, centrally mounted to a slender metal frame supporting a saddle seat and vertical fork. The absence of handlebars, a second wheel, or mechanical drivetrain distinguishes it from bicycles. The frame often exhibits a Y-shaped or straight tubular design, with pedals directly attached to the wheel hub. Textures include smooth metal surfaces and grooved tire treads. Common color contrasts include black tires against metallic frames or brightly colored seats.",
    "86": "Objects classified as \"upright\" exhibit a primary vertical axis perpendicular to the ground, with a stable base-to-top progression and minimal lateral deviation. Their dominant linear structure contrasts with sloping or sprawling forms, often displaying uniform symmetry or parallel alignment of components (e.g., limbs, branches, or edges) along the central axis. Textures may repeat directionally along the vertical plane, reinforcing the orientation.",
    "87": "A vase typically exhibits a hollow, vertically oriented form with a flared or tapered opening, a distinct neck narrowing toward the base, and a stable foot. Surfaces may display smooth, glazed textures or decorative relief patterns, often symmetrical along the central axis. Common proportions emphasize height over width, with curvilinear or angular contours differentiating it from utilitarian containers like bowls or jars.",
    "88": "A **wok** is a round-bottomed cooking vessel with a wide, flared rim and sloping sides, typically made of metal with a smooth, reflective or matte surface. Its deep, bowl-like structure distinguishes it from flat pans, often featuring a single long handle or two small loop handles. The curvature is uniform, tapering sharply from the rim to the base, and may show wear patterns like darkened or sooty patches from heat exposure.",
    "89": "A worm fence consists of zigzagging, interlocking wooden rails stacked in a continuous, undulating pattern, forming a crisscross structure with diagonal symmetry. The rails are typically uniform in thickness, often weathered to a muted gray or brown, and lack vertical posts, distinguishing it from straight or post-supported fences. The texture is rough, with visible wood grain and occasional gaps between rails.",
    "90": "A yawl is a two-masted sailing vessel with a shorter mizzen mast stepped aft of the rudder post, distinct from a ketch by its smaller, more rearward mizzen. The mainsail is typically larger than the mizzen sail, and the hull is often slender with a pronounced sheerline. Wooden construction may show visible planking seams, while modern variants feature smooth fiberglass finishes. The mizzen mast is noticeably shorter and more vertical than the main mast, creating a staggered, asymmetrical silhouette.",
    "91": "Street signs are typically flat, rigid panels with geometric shapes (rectangular, square, or trapezoidal) and high-contrast color patterns (e.g., dark text/symbols on light backgrounds or vice versa), often framed by reflective borders or raised edges. Their surfaces are smooth and untextured, with standardized typography and pictograms arranged centrally or symmetrically. Mounting poles or overhead arms provide structural support, distinguishing them from non-signage planar objects.",
    "92": "ConsommÃ© appears as a clear, amber to golden-hued broth with a smooth, glossy surface, often free of particulates, distinguished by its high translucency and occasional thin fat droplets or shimmering collagen sheen.",
    "93": "A trifle is a layered dessert with alternating bands of sponge cake, custard, fruit, and whipped cream, often topped with decorative garnishes like sprinkles or shaved chocolate. The strata vary in opacity and texture, from spongy and porous to smooth and creamy, creating a distinct vertical gradient when viewed in cross-section. Jellied fruit layers may exhibit a glossy, translucent appearance, contrasting with the matte, aerated surface of whipped cream. The overall structure is typically contained in a clear glass dish, emphasizing its multicolored, stratified composition.",
    "94": "A hotdog typically appears as an elongated, cylindrical meat-based core with a smooth, uniform surface, encased in a lightly textured, golden-brown bun that splits partially along its length, often with visible longitudinal seams and condiment streaks like mustard or ketchup.",
    "95": "Oranges are spherical to slightly oblate fruits with a dimpled, pebbled rind texture, often exhibiting a vibrant orange hue. The surface is marked by shallow pores (oil glands) and may have a faint longitudinal ridge near the stem. The rind transitions smoothly into a pithy, white inner layer, enclosing segmented, juicy flesh with a glossy, vesicular texture.",
    "96": "A cliff is characterized by a steep, near-vertical or overhanging rock face with sharp edges, irregular fractures, and exposed stratified layers or jagged textures, often contrasting with smoother surrounding terrain. Its surface may show weathered cracks, ledges, or abrupt transitions in color due to mineral deposits or erosion patterns.",
    "97": "A coral reef exhibits a complex, irregular three-dimensional structure composed of interconnected calcium carbonate formations with rough, porous textures, often branching, fanning, or mound-like. Colonies display vibrant patches of color (e.g., blues, pinks, or oranges) contrasting against neutral tones, with polyps forming small, repetitive circular or slit-like patterns across surfaces. The dense, jagged matrix distinguishes it from smoother rock or sponge textures.  \n\n(Word count: 30)",
    "98": "Bolete mushrooms typically exhibit a stout, fleshy stipe with a bulbous or tapered base, a convex to cushion-shaped cap with a dry, velvety or smooth surface, and a porous, sponge-like hymenophore instead of gills. The cap and stipe often display a contrasting texture, with the cap sometimes cracking or developing fine reticulation on the stipe. Their coloration varies but frequently includes muted tones with subtle gradations.",
    "99": "The ear is a curved, shell-like structure with a prominent helical rim enclosing the concha, often displaying fine ridges and folds (e.g., antihelix, tragus). Skin texture varies from smooth to lightly wrinkled, with a thin, translucent appearance in some areas, while the earlobe may be fleshy and detached or seamlessly attached. Subtle vascular patterns or faint hair coverage may be visible depending on lighting and resolution."
